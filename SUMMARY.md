# Hacker News Clone - Project Summary

## Project Status

✅ **Fully implemented**:
- Backend API with Hono.js (authentication, posts, voting, comments)
- Frontend with Next.js App Router (homepage, post details, submit form, auth pages)
- Database schema with Drizzle ORM for Cloudflare D1
- JWT-based authentication with password hashing
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Testing setup with Vitest for backend and Jest for frontend
- Support for multiple deployment options including Cloudflare Pages
- pnpm workspace configuration for efficient dependency management

## Security Review

✅ **Addressed Security Concerns**:
1. **JWT Implementation**: Uses strong HS256 algorithm with expiration
2. **Password Security**: Uses argon2 for password hashing (industry standard)
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses Drizzle ORM which prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries
4. **Authentication**: Proper middleware for protected routes with token validation
5. **CORS**: Configured for controlled cross-origin access

⚠️ **Areas for Further Improvement**:
1. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
2. **Input Validation**: Add more comprehensive validation for user inputs
3. **JWT Secret Management**: Move secret to environment variables in production
4. **Error Handling**: Implement structured logging for security events

## Code Quality

✅ **KISS Principles Applied**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Well-documented functions with JSDoc comments
- Consistent naming conventions
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation

## Key Features Implemented

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Registration with email/username/password
   - Login with JWT tokens
   - Password hashing with argon2

2. **Post Management**:
   - Submit new posts (URL or text posts)
   - View posts sorted by hot score
   - View individual post details

3. **Voting System**:
   - Upvote/downvote posts
   - Score calculation (upvotes - downvotes)

4. **Comment System**:
   - Add comments to posts
   - View comments on post pages

5. **UI/UX**:
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Navigation header with auth state
   - Clean Hacker News-like interface
